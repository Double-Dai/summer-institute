The SICSS Festival 2020 will take place Monday, June 22 - Friday, June 26, 2020. During the festival, alumni from all SICSS locations would host events such as tutorials, panel discussions, or debates.  These events will all be online.  SICSS Festival events will be open to either current SICSS participants (at any location) or anyone that is interested; the choice of audience will be driven by the topic, learning objectives, and preferences of presenters.  If you are a SICSS alumni and would like to host an event in the festival, please send us an email with a rough sketch of your idea.  We will be adding events to this website as they are finalized.

## Panel discussion on teaching computational social science

__Time:__ Monday, June 22, 2020. 12-1pm EDT

__Speakers:__ [Matti Nelimarkka](https://matti.mante.li/) (SICSS-Princeton 17), [Rochelle Terman](http://rochelleterman.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 17), and [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/) (SICSS-Princeton 19)

__Moderator:__ [Matthew Salganik](https://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, SICSS-Duke 18, SICSS-Princeton 19, SICSS-Duke 20)

__Description:__ Teaching computational social science at both the undergraduate and graduate level presents a number of challenging pedagogical questions. How should we teach a class with students from different disciplinary backgrounds?  What is the role of programming in computational social science education? How should computational social science courses fit into a larger curriculum?  The panelists will address these questions---and others---first in a moderated conversation and then will take questions from the audience.   

__Open to:__ Unlimited registered participants: [Registration form](https://forms.gle/mCdyY2VPZdLGjqKTA)

## Computational social science to address the (post) COVID-19 reality

__Time:__ Wednesday, June 24, 2020, 10–11:15am EDT

__Speakers:__ [Johan Bollen](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/jbollen/) and [Dean Eckles](https://www.deaneckles.com/)

__Moderators:__ [Mark Cliffe](https://think.ing.com/author/mark-cliffe/) and [Monika Leszczynska](https://empiricalcontracts.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 19, SICSS-Maastricht 20)

__Description:__ Computational Social Science offers tools that can assist both policy makers and the private sector in the design and implementation of measures to address the economic and social challenges posed by COVID-19. How can the growing sources of (alternative) data and data science be used in a meaningful and responsible way, i.e. providing reliable and practical knowledge without compromising privacy and safety of people whose data is collected and analyzed? What are the methodological and regulatory solutions that could be applied to address the challenges and mitigate the risks? Our panelists will share their experience and ideas on these issues. There will also be enough time for questions from the audience.

Co-organized with the [Maastricht Law and Tech Lab](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/law/research/law-and-tech-lab), [ING](https://www.ing.com/), and the [Think Forward Initiative](https://www.thinkforwardinitiative.com/)

__Open to:__ Unlimited registered participants: [Registration form](https://legal.typeform.com/to/ZOb9SY)

## Panel discussion on digital and computational demography

__Time:__ Wednesday, June 24, 2020. 11:30am-12:30pm EDT

__Speakers:__ [Nicolò Cavalli](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/graduate/nicolo-cavalli.html) (SICSS-Duke 18, SICSS-Oxford 19), [Ridhi Kashyap](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/ridhi-kashyap/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, SICSS-Oxford 19),  and [Francesco Rampazzo](https://francescorampazzo.com/) (SICSS-Duke 18)

__Moderator:__ [Vissého Adjiwanou](https://sociologie.uqam.ca/corps-professoral/professeurs-es/professeur/adjiwanou.visseho/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, SICSS-Cape Town 18, SICSS-Cape Town 19, SICSS-Montreal 20)

__Description:__ The panel will begin with a broad introduction to digital and computational approaches to demography.  Next, panelists will present examples drawing on some of their own work  of digital and computational approaches to demographic research in two areas: 1) migration and 2) digital inequality and its implications for demographic processes.  Following these specific examples, the panel will reflect on future directions for digital demography, both in the context of the promises and perils of this emerging area in demographic research, as well as in relation to its role within the broader computational social science community.  We aim for this conversation to include a wider discussion between panelists and participants, and encourage broad participation from those within computational social science, demography and population studies communities.
