From January 3 to January 9 of 2021, the SICSS core sponsors and the University of Arizona will sponsor the first Winter Institute in Computational Social Science, a partner site for SICSS. The purpose of the event is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty interested in computational social science. The event will be held virtually, and is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and hands-on methods training. There will be several guest speakers conducting data and social science research in a variety of fields, including communication, linguistics, political science, and sociology. Topics covered include data ethics, experimental methods, digital traces and web scraping, social network modeling, text analysis, and geographic information systems. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. 

Approximately twenty to thirty participants will be selected. Participants are expected to be present for the entire one-week program.

Application materials are due by November 1, 2020.
