\textbf{The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study is a dataset of real people who have selflessly opened up their lives to us for the last 15 years so that their experiences can contribute to scientific research. By participating in the Fragile Families Challenge activity, you become a collaborator in this project. It is of the utmost importance that you respect the families in the data by using what they have told us responsibly.}
