# SICSS Group Exercise Week 2, Day 2

## Collecting Digital Trace Data

Today the videos covered a broad range of topics including screen-scraping, working with APIs, and building apps and bots for social science research. Some of you may have already had experience with some or even most of these issuesâ€“ but for others, this may have been your first time collecting digital trace data. This exercise is designed to find a balance between practicing rudimentary skills (for those of you with little or no experience in this area) to cutting edge techniques (for those of you with extensive expertise in this area). As an added bonus, this exercise not only challenges you to practice your coding skills, but to think about how to ask questions that contribute new knowledge to social science theory as well.

- First, identify a research question that you believe can be answered using some of the methods discussed in today's videos.
- Identify a sampling frame to help you answer this research question. For example, if your question is about politics, your sampling frame might be a list of elected officials on Twitter;
- Use (legal) screen-scraping techniques in order to collect the names of individual accounts, keywords, or topic areas to populate your sample.
- Write code to collect data from each unit of analysis in your sample (e.g. tweets of elected officials)
- Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the data you have collected
- Outline a hybrid research design (e.g. an app or a bot) that could be used to address the weaknesses of the data you collected, or otherwise improve your ability to answer the research question.

Share the results of your work on slack.
