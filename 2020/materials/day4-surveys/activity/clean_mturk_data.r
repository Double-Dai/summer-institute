# Clean mturk responses

# Desired output
# Opinion Questions would have column name as question label, values would be either 1 or 0. 
# 1 represents the response according to the label in the following file.
# https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2020/materials/day4-surveys/activity/pew_benchmark_question_source_sicss_2020.csv
# For example, an 1 in COVIDSM.1 means that the respondent answered "Yes, I get news about coronavirus outbreak on social media". 
# 
# Demographic
# Follow Cambria's Example


# Step 1: Load MTurk survey data

### Before downloading data
# - Dropped responses that did not select "I agree" on consent check
# - Dropped duplicates, responses that did not pass attention screening questions
# - Deleted MTurk worker ID, consent check, and timestamp variables
# - Rename column names 

### Load data and tidy
# - Download responses (as .csv) from Google Forms and load
# - Rename responses into 1 and 0 for opinion questions
# - Rename responses to match match names in Pew benchmark and cleaned ACS data for demographics questions
