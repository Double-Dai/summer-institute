From July 3 to July 14, 2022, the University of Haifa will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings. Topics covered include data preparation and pre-processing using Python, text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning using Orange, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Applications from PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers will be given priority but applications from faculty members will also be considered. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. Up to 25 participants will be invited to participate with tuition and dining covered by the organizers. Selected participants are requested to commit to the full duration of the entire two-week program or otherwise relinquish their spot to other candidates.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2022/haifa/apply) are due May 1st.
