From June 20 to July 1, 2022, [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en/) will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at Ecole Polytechnique. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, coding workshops, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in academia or industry. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to advanced Master students, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and early career stage faculty. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science, such as women and scholars from the African continent. Housing and a couple of meals can be covered by us. We can also grant a travel allowance to students who are in need for it. About 25 participants will be invited. Participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2022/paris/apply) are due March 20th.
