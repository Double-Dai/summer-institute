# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to advanced master students, Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career stage faculty from Europe and Africa. We explicitly encourage applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across different levels of technical experience. Language of instruction is English for which we require good reading and speaking command. Participants need to be familiar with at least one scripting language and the courses will be taught in R. Participants with little experience with coding in R are expected to complete a SICSS boot camp upfront. Participants with less experience with social science research are expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the summer school.

When making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 

1. research and teaching in the area of computational social science
2. contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others
3. likelihood to benefit from participation
4. likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants
5. potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research.

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents:

* CV including an e-mail address and an alternative means of contact (e.g., phone number) and without picture
* Statement of intent (maximum two pages) describing research interests and how they can benefit from computational methods
* OPTIONAL (if travel allowance required): justification for travel allowance including exemplary itinerary and required costs.

**In order to be guaranteed consideration, all application materials must be submitted by March 20, 2022.** All application materials must be submitted through [e-mail](mailto:SICSSParis@gmail.com). We will notify applicants solely through e-mail by April 10, 2022, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

Inquiries can be sent to SICSSParis@gmail.com.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Paris, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Paris if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
