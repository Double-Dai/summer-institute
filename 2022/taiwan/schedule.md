# Schedule

We have designed a 6-week learning program. We will cover text as data, website scraping, online experiments, machine learning, data visualization and ethics in computational social science.

## Part I: Bootcamp (Online courses, self-paced) 

During the four-week bootcamp from June 20, 2022 to July 17, 2022, participants should plan to spend 5 to 10 hours each week. We will issue two assignments. One assignment is on data visualization, data wrangling, and programming in R. The other assignment is on introduction to computational social science. There will be office hours for participants to interact with teaching staff. Participants are expected to complete self-learning materials prior to the Summer Institute. 

## Part II: Summer Institute (hybrid program, including online live + in-person formats) 

During the two-week component, participants will meet from 9AM to 5PM for a total of 11 days.   
- Online: July 18 (Monday) - July 22 (Friday), July 25 (Monday) - July 27 (Wednesday)
