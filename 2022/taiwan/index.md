The Russel Sage Foundation and the International College of Innovation (ICI) of National Chengchi University will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science - Taiwan (SICSS-Taiwan). The purpose of SICSS-Taiwan is to bring together people interested in applying data science and computational methods to better understand human behaviors and social phenomena. We aim to facilitate inclusive learning and effective collaboration in computational social science. 

The target audience of our six-week program is graduate students, researchers and professionals with backgrounds in data science and/or social sciences. We will select a cohort of 25 participants who are motivated to be in an interdisciplinary community of learners and collaborators. We especially welcome applicants new to computational social science. Other than deposit, there is no registration fee and participants will receive subsidies in housing and transportation for the in-person component. 

The six-week program consists of two components: a self-paced, fully remote learning bootcamp from June 20 to July 17, and a synchronous and hybrid program from July 18 to July 30. The program features flipped-classroom and participant-driven learning. 

During the bootcamp, SICSS-Taiwan organizers will help participants build common set of language in computational social science research questions and data science skills. Participants should budget 5-10 hours weekly during this phase.  

From July 18 to July 30, participants will participate in lectures, group problem sets, code-along tutorials, collaborative discussion activities, lightning talks, and participant-led projects. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. In the second half of the two-week program, participants will form 3-5 person teams to develop research or tutorial projects related to computational social science.  

Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2022/taiwan/apply) will be announced at the end of January, 2022. 

We are hosting monthly 30 min info sessions online from December to March. You can [subscribe to our email updates](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_rtXqZHelZ1RlJYJi4oBB95gL0kza0vWlyNcqF5UnXg7gUw/viewform?usp=sf_link) regarding the upcoming SICSS-Taiwan information.
