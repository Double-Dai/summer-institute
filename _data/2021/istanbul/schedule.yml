    - name: "**[Pre-SICSS Tasks](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2020/materials/istanbul/pre-SICSS%20tasks.md)**<br/>This 2-week pre-SICSS period will feature a number of essential computational social science readings, along with programming foundation modules to bridge everyone’s diverse skill set. Even if you have excellent programming skills, please go along with us through this period, so that when the actual SICSS begins, you’ll already have a good sense of common problems and skill sets, so that you can get an understanding of who to partner with during the second week of SICSS, where groups will come up with their own research questions and work on it for an entire week."
    - name: "**Coffee Talks**<br/> While working Pre-SICSS tasks, informal small group coffee talks will be organized to share our experiences, discuss on project ideas, talk about SICSS materials, and chat on participant's questions."

Additionally, we will organize method workshops with hands-on experience. You will also have speed dating sessions to establish your group for the second week program and you are expected to report your group members and a short description of your group project at the end of the week."

  name: Automated Methods of Protest Event Collection
  events:
     - name: "**Research Talk**<br/> Protest event analysis is the most common approach for social movement scholars as it is an unobtrusive and context-sensitive technique that can convert unstructured matter into large volumes of data, in a cross-national, cross-time and cross-issue comparative character. The use of digitized new sources and automated approaches to collect protest events information has accelerated in the 2000s. The selection bias problem, substantial labor costs, and generalizability problems associated with manual coding have constituted the demand conditions for automated methods. What makes automation possible was the big data revolution, which generated vast amounts of news sources digitally available to researchers. Besides, the unprecedented computational power that was built by new generations of processors finally enabled the application of artificial intelligence techniques that had been developed long ago. Henceforth, several very large projects were formed to apply fully or semi-automated methods to collect contentious political event data from news sources, such as GDELT, ICEWS, EMBERS and SPEED, POLCON, and MMAD. In this presentation, we will describe the potentials and challenges of using artificial intelligence to understand social movements and then I will present the new bottom-up methodological approach that has adopted by our European Research Council (ERC) funded project to overcome these challenges."

Up until this date, you should have an idea of which participants you’d like to team up with and the research question that you’ll work on. Teams that people built in previous SICSS_Istanbul events have flourished into full-fledged research groups, presenting their SICSS papers at APSA, ASA and beyond!"
