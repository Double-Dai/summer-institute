  bio: n my research I work on various dimensions of economic inequality. I explain and demonstrate why and how economic inequality in Israel, the U.S. and other developed societies is related to institutional (e.g., labor unions) and structural (i.e., the linkages among jobs, firms, industries, and occupations) features of labor markets, which create differences in the ways incomes are allocated to individuals.
