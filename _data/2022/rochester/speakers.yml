  bio: "Maps, foreign loans, and East Asian History are my specialty. In my research and teaching, I explore the financial and spatial history of capitalism, with China as my corner stone. I have taught fourteen different Asia-related courses and have completed a book manuscript on China’s foreign borrowing from America. As a teacher-scholar, I have also systematically tested the integration of scientific map-making into undergraduate research and have attracted 252 students from 51 majors to experiment outside their comfort zones."
