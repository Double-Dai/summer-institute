- name: Tim Riffe
  bio: Tim Riffe is a demographer, with a research focus in data, formal methods, mortality, population health, data visualization, and open science. He did a post doc doing data infrastructure programming and data curation at the Human Mortality Database (2012-2015, University of California, Berkeley). He was a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (2015-2021), and since 2021 he has been an Ikerbasque Research Fellow and Visiting Professor at the University of the Basque Country. Some of his current methods projects include i) developing indirect methods for measuring health disparities, ii) a measurement framework for demographic life-course based measures of health, and iii) decomposition approaches to characterize life course disparities in health and longevity. In 2020 he founded the COVerAGE Database, a global demographic database of COVID-19 cases, deaths, tests, and vaccinations, which has underpinned efforts to monitor the pandemic at the WHO, UN-DESA, UNICEF, and in the global health literature. He also serve on the WHO / UN-DESA Technical Advisory Group for COVID-19 Excess Mortality, where his primary contribution aims to characterize age patterns of COVID-19 direct mortality and all-cause excess mortality for 2020, based on combining various global datasets. He regularly teach short workshops on R programming, demography, and data visualization in programs such as BSSD, EDSD, PHDS, and others.
