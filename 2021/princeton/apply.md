Participation is restricted to ______. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment.  About ______ participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time.  For example, you can apply to SICSS-Princeton, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline.  However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Where do I submit recommendation letters?

If you have recommendation letters, add the email addresses for your two recommenders to your application in Fluxx; they will receive an email with instructions on how to submit. Applicants should not submit recommendation letters on their own. If one of your recommenders did not receive an email from Fluxx, have them check their spam folder; otherwise, contact us and we can help you troubleshoot the issue. Please be mindful of the application deadline when informing your recommenders about the submission process.

#### I'm having trouble creating an account on Fluxx to submit my application.

If you are confused about some of the application fields (e.g. Organization EIN), please just input as much information as you can. Also note that the account creation process can take a couple of days; please plan to create an account on Fluxx well in advance of the application deadline.
