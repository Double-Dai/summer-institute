# General Overview

1. First, read this overview and watch the video: [https://docs.empirica.ly/](https://docs.empirica.ly/) But don't actually install anything, just watch!  We'll give you instructions later for a quick installation, if you use one of our recommended setups.
2. Watch the rest of the videos in this playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2YhEZey_58&list=PLPQelvUwyVgiawBDk3Sp74QMfL8RPgORW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2YhEZey_58&list=PLPQelvUwyVgiawBDk3Sp74QMfL8RPgORW) (about 10 mins total)
3. Get your system set up.  See more below.
4. Then, follow this tutorial to create a shell app: [https://docs.empirica.ly/getting-started/quick-start](https://docs.empirica.ly/getting-started/quick-start)
5. At this point, pause and play around a bit.  Make sure you understand what's going on.  Ask questions.
6. Finally, proceed through the "Your First Experiment" tutorial.  Part 1 is a good goal for today: [https://docs.empirica.ly/guides/tutorial-your-first-experiment](https://docs.empirica.ly/guides/tutorial-your-first-experiment)

# How to use this tutorial

After following the instructions below for 'system setup', you might be asking:  how do I actually do all this?  This section provides a brief overview of how everything works.

# System Setup: Mac/Linux

### Mac/Linux 1. Install Meteor:
For a Mac or Linux system, open the 'terminal' app and enter the following commands.
    curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

### Mac/Linux 2. Install NPM *ON MAC*:
For a Mac, enter the following commands in terminal.  For Linux, use your appropriate installer (e.g. apt install).
    brew update
    brew install node

# System Setup: Windows

### Windows option 1: Windows Native
You can try to get everything installed on Windows native.  We don't have instructions on that.

### Windows option 2: Windows Subsystem Linux 2 (WSL2)
WSL2 is a modern tool introduced by Microsoft to facilitate the use of common web development tools, which generally run on Linux-like systems. We've created a set of instructions that help streamline this process.

Instructions: [https://docs.empirica.ly/getting-started/setup/windows-instructions](https://docs.empirica.ly/getting-started/setup/windows-instructions)

### Windows option 3:  **Linux cloud server**
You may find it easier to set up a linux cloud server with a service such as Amazon Web Services or DigitalOcean.  Many of these provide a free trial tier that is sufficient for today's exercise.

If none of the options above work for you, and you don't have access to a cloud server, we can provide one.  Just post a message in the &#35;server-request channel and someone will be with you in a few minutes.
