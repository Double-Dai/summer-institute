From Monday, June 14 to Friday, June 25, 2021, the UCL School of Management will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be hosted virtually by UCL in partnership with London School of Economics, Imperial College London, Greenwich University, and City, University of London. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participants planning a group project in Week 2 will have the opportunity to apply for a limited number of mini-grants to support efforts such as pilot data collection or dataset purchases.

Participation is restricted to early career researchers. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science.  Participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire program.

Application materials will be posted soon.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, all events will take place online.
